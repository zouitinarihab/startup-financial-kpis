# Startup Financial KPI Dashboard (DuckDB + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project simulates the financial performance of a startup and builds an executive-level dashboard to monitor revenue, expenses, burn rate, and runway.

The objective is to demonstrate **financial analysis, KPI design, and decision support** using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

- What is the monthly burn rate and how volatile is it?
- How many months of runway remain at the current burn?
- Which cost categories and departments drive expenses?
- How efficient is the company (cost-to-revenue ratio)?
